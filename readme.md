# Calculator

## Overview

### Background
A simple calculator. Supports +, -, *, /, and (). To create an expression for evaluation, please press the calculator buttons or click in the text box labeled "Expression" and start typing. Click on "=" to see the result.

For your convenience, the calculator saves a list of your recent results. It also has three selectable modes for when you click on "=" and it successfully evaluates your expression:
* In "Clear" mode, the calculator will delete the contents of the input text box.
* In "Keep" mode, the calculator will keep your expression (useful if you want to test many small variations on a given expression, especially if it's a long or complicated one).
* In "Replace" mode, the calculator will show the answer in both the list at the top and the input text box (useful if you want to do further calculations with the result of a calculation).
